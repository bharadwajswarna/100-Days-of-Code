# Palindrome Number
# Input: x = -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        check = [i for i in str(x)]
        if check ==  check[::-1]:

          c = False
        return c
